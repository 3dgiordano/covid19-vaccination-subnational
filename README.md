# covid19-vaccination-subnational
This project aims to gather COVID-19 vaccination data at subnational level for as many countries as possible. The data
can be found in [data.csv](output/data.csv).

This project is inspired by [owid/covid-19-data](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data) and is open to integration if
deemed approriate.

It works by running scripts on a daily basis, which gather data from different [sources](#sources).
